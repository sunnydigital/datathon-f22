## Problem Statement

The goal in this Datathon is to act as developers for the host company of this datathon, Peak.AI, and develop a recommender system model for our customer, the Brazilian e-commerce company Olist, to advertise products to users based off of previous purchase history

We then joined all necessary tables to determine all relevant orders based on the primary key of `customer_id`, at the neds related to `product_id` with the entity relationship diagrams shown below:
